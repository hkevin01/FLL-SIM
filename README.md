### Timeline

- Phase 3.5 Completed — July 2025
- Phase 4 In Progress — Q1 2026

- All core competition features implemented and tested.
- Multi-robot support, official timer, scoring, and advanced reliability simulation are live.
- Educational modules (tutorial system, guided exercises) under development.
- Developer guide for educational features now available.
- Automated tests for all educational modules run in venv (`fll-sim-env/bin/python`).

## 🎯 Overview

FLL-Sim provides a virtual environment for testing and developing strategies for First Lego League competitions. The simulator includes:

- **Robot Simulation**: Physics-based LEGO robot with customizable sensors and actuators
- **Map Environment**: Interactive game mat with missions and obstacles
- **Mission Framework**: Configurable challenges based on FLL seasons
- **Visualization**: Real-time 2D/3D visualization of robot and environment
- **Programming Interface**: Python API for robot control and autonomous programming
- **Competition Mode**: Official FLL timer, rules enforcement, scoring, and tournament features
- **Multi-Robot Support**: Simulate multiple robots, team coordination, and collision
- **Advanced Simulation**: Battery, hardware reliability, and performance analytics

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Realistic robot physics simulation
- ✅ Customizable robot configurations
- ✅ Interactive game mat with obstacles and missions
- ✅ Sensor simulation (color, ultrasonic, gyro, touch)
- ✅ Motor control and movement mechanics
- ✅ Mission scoring system
- ✅ Real-time visualization
- ✅ Educational programming interface
- ✅ Competition timer and rules enforcement
- ✅ Multi-robot simulation and coordination
- ✅ Advanced reliability and performance analytics
- ✅ **New:** Modular tutorial system and guided programming exercises (Phase 4)
- ✅ **Planned:** Community content sharing, curriculum integration, and AI-driven features

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FLL-Sim
```text

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```python

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Install the package in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```text

## 🎮 Quick Start

```python
from fll_sim import Robot, GameMap, Simulator

# Create a robot
robot = Robot(x=100, y=100, angle=0)

# Load a game map
game_map = GameMap.load_season("2024-submerged")

# Create simulator
sim = Simulator(robot, game_map)

# Run simulation
sim.start()

# Program your robot
robot.move_forward(distance=500)  # Move 500mm forward
robot.turn_left(degrees=90)       # Turn 90 degrees left
robot.move_forward(distance=300)  # Move 300mm forward
```

## 📚 Documentation

- [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md)
- [Developer Guide](docs/developer_guide_education.md)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite (always use the project venv):

```bash
fll-sim-env/bin/python -m unittest tests/
```

Run with coverage:

```bash
fll-sim-env/bin/python -m coverage run -m unittest tests/
fll-sim-env/bin/python -m coverage html
```

## 🐳 Docker Usage

Production & testing images are built via the multi-stage Dockerfile in `docker/Dockerfile`.

### Build Image

```bash
docker build -t fll-sim -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

### Run Headless Tests (CI parity)

```bash
docker run --rm -e FLL_SIM_HEADLESS=1 fll-sim python -m unittest -v tests
```

### Launch Headless Demo

```bash
docker run --rm -e FLL_SIM_HEADLESS=1 fll-sim fll-sim --headless --exit-after 5
```

### Launch GUI (Linux X11)

Allow local X access (one-time):

```bash
xhost +local:root
docker run --rm \
	-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
	-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
	fll-sim fll-sim-gui --exit-after 5
```

Wayland users may export `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland` or fallback to `xcb`.

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build sim-headless
docker compose run --rm sim-gui
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb"` | Install host X11 libs, ensure volume mount of /tmp/.X11-unix |
| Black window / no display | Verify DISPLAY and permissions (use `xhost +local:root`) |
| Wayland warnings | Set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` |

### Host system pygame (optional)

If your OS enforces PEP 668 (externally managed Python), system-wide `pip install` may be blocked. Prefer using the bundled virtual environment (`fll-sim-env/`) or install pygame via your package manager:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-pygame`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-pygame`
- RHEL/CentOS: `sudo yum install python3-pygame`

Alternatively, we provide a helper target and script:

- Makefile target: `make install-system-pygame`
- Script: `scripts/install-system-pygame.sh` (falls back to `pip install pygame --break-system-packages` when necessary)

Docker builds already install pygame from `requirements.txt` inside an isolated venv in the image.


## 🪟 Windows Executable (Preview)

PyInstaller packaging (onefile/onedir) will be provided under `scripts/build_windows_exe.ps1` and a spec in `packaging/`. After build the GUI can be launched via the generated `FLL-Sim.exe`.

Planned features:

- Bundled Qt platform plugins (qwindows, styles, imageformats)
- Custom application icon
- About dialog with version + license

## 🧰 CLI Entry Points

After `pip install -e .` you can use:

```bash
fll-sim --headless --exit-after 3
fll-sim-gui --exit-after 5
```


Use `--headless` (or env `FLL_SIM_HEADLESS=1`) for CI and container runs.
